/**
 * Problem Introduction
 * The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and
 * substitutions of symbols) to transform one string into another. It is a measure of similarity of two strings.
 * Edit distance has applications, for example, in computational biology, natural language processing,
 * and spell checking. Your goal in this problem is to compute the edit distance between two strings.
 * Problem Description
 * Task. The goal of this problem is to implement the algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings.
 * Input Format. Each of the two lines of the input contains a string consisting of lower case latin letters.
 * Constraints. The length of both strings is at least 1 and at most 100.
 * Output Format. Output the edit distance between the given two strings.
 * Sample 1.
 * Input:
 * ab
 * ab
 * Output:
 * 0
