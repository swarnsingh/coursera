/**
 * Problem Introduction
 * You are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible into your bag.
 * There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not (hence you cannot take a
 * fraction of a bar).
 * Problem Description
 * Task. Given 𝑛 gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity 𝑊 .
 * Input Format. The first line of the input contains the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack and the number 𝑛 of bars
 * of gold. The next line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑤0 , 𝑤1 , . . . , 𝑤𝑛−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.
 * Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑊 ≤ 10^4; 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 300; 0 ≤ 𝑤0,...,𝑤𝑛−1 ≤ 10^5.
 * Output Format. Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity 𝑊 .
 * Sample 1.
 * Input:
 * 10 3
 * 1 4 8
 * Output:
 * 9
 * Here, the sum of the weights of the first and the last bar is equal to 9.
