/**
 * <h1>Inline functions</h1>
 * <p>
 * In Kotlin 2.0.0, the K2 compiler treats inline functions differently, allowing it to determine in combination with
 * other compiler analyses whether it's safe to smart-cast.
 *
 * Specifically, inline functions are now treated as having an implicit callsInPlace contract. This means that any lambda
 * functions passed to an inline function are called in place. Since lambda functions are called in place, the compiler
 * knows that a lambda function can't leak references to any variables contained within its function body.
 *
 * The compiler uses this knowledge along with other compiler analyses to decide whether it's safe to smart-cast any of
 * the captured variables. For example:
 * </p>

/**
 * Type checks with the logical or operatorï»¿

 * common supertype. Before this change, a smart cast was always made to the Any type.
 *
 * In this case, you still had to manually check the object type afterward before you could access any of its properties
 * or call its functions. For example:
